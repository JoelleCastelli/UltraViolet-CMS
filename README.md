# ULTRAVIOLET

Framework and CMS from scratch with PHP7.
The CMS is meant to let users create their own website about movies and tv shows thanks to a TMDB-based database.

# To Launch the projet :
1. run `docker-compose up -d` in the root directory
2. run `npm install` in `www/webpack` to get node dependancies
3. run `npm run build` also in `www/webpack` to build the front located in `www/dist` directory
